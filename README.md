# WHY BUILD THESE NODES?

There are many ways to do composition and it is apparent that is a large portion of what Computer Vision - aka contemporaneous "A.I" - is invented to resolve.

While diffusers and latent hallucinations can make many amazing things at the moment, there is still a need to resolve final "frames" in something else, like one of the many free tools:
* [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) (2D)
* [Calvary](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/) (motion graphics)
* [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) (movie editing)

The main goal of Jovimetrix is to supplement those external workflows before the need to use them.

## TARGETS

* animation / motion graphics
* traditional image blending
* support masks as an image channel
* improved UX
** custom node colorization
** node favorites

# INSTALLATION

## COMFYUI MANAGER

If you have [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) installed, simply search for Jovimetrix and install from the manager's database.

## MANUAL INSTALL
Clone the repository into your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory. You can clone the repository with the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Amorano/Jovimetrix.git
```
You can then install the requirements by using the command:
```
.\python_embed\python.exe -s -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are using a <code>virtual environment</code> (<code><i>venv</i></code>), make sure it is activated before installation. Then install the requirements with the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### LOGGER

The logger can be controlled via the JOV_LOG_LEVEL variable. It can be set to one of the following, by name or value:

* TRACE (5)
* DEBUG (10)
* INFO (20)
* SUCCESS (25)
* WARNING (30)
* ERROR (40)
* CRITICAL (50)

The default is WARNING (30); i.e.:

`SET JOV_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`

### IGNORE NODES

Because there are a number of nodes that have overlapping functionality with other node packages, I have provided a mechanism to ignore loading of specific nodes.

If you create a file called `ignore.txt` inside the Jovimetrix root folder \(`.../ComfyUI/custom_nodes/Jovimetrix`\), it will skip loading any nodes included.

#### USAGE

Each entry should be on a separate line using the full node class name (the default name of the node). For example, in ignore.txt:

`CONSTANT (JOV) üü™`

Will ignore the Constant node for use in ComfyUI.

This will *NOT* prevent the module from loading the imports, but this can help reduce your visual space while working within ComfyUI if you do not require looking at an additional 60+ nodes.


### SYSTEM DEVICE SCAN

Allows the system to auto-scan for any devices, so that it can populate the device list in the Stream Reader Node.

The [STREAM READERüì∫](https://github.com/Amorano/Jovimetrix/wiki/DEVICE#-stream-reader) is able to load media from local media, web media dna also system devices such as (virtual) web cameras and monitors. By default, the scan for web cameras is off.

If you wish to engage the auto-scan on ComfyUI start-up, set the JOV_SCAN_DEVICES variable to 1 or True.

`SET JOV_SCAN_DEVICES=1`

### HELP SYSTEM

The main help system is made possible by [Mel Massadian](https://github.com/melMass). It is located on the top right of each node (?). This will present a window which is loaded from the [main help repository for Jovimetrix](https://github.com/Amorano/Jovimetrix-examples/)

You can build all the help locally by loading Comfy and surfing to the local URL:

`http://127.0.0.1:8188/jovimetrix/doc`

This will build all the help stub files (.md) inside the main Jovimetrix folder under a folder named `_md`

If you wish to re-direct those outputs, you can set the ENV varible `JOV_SIDECAR`.

e.g.
`SET JOV_SIDECAR=C:/dev/jvx/help`

### GIFSKI SUPPORT

If you have [GIFSKI](https://gif.ski/) installed you can enable the option for the Export Node to use GIFSKI when outputting frames.

You will need to add an environment var so it knows you have it installed and where:

`SET JOV_GIFSKI=[path to gifski]`

Once set the GIFSKI option should appear in the Export Node drop down list of output target formats.

### PYAUDIO

By default, pyaudio is installed for all platforms; however, it may be nessicary to run a specific platform package manager to obtain all the correct platform dependencies. [You can refer to the non-complicated specific platform instructions for help.](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio).

In short:
* For MacOS you need the extra brew package of portaudio. (brew install portaudio)
* For Linux you need the extra apt package of python3-pyaudio. (sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio)

### SPOUT (WINDOWS ONLY)

If you are on Linux or Mac, `Spout` will not be installed from the requirements.txt.

By default, [Spout](https://leadedge.github.io/), a system for GPU accelerated sharing
of graphics between applications, is on for all platforms.

If you are on Mac or Linux, this will only amount to a message at startup about Spout not being used. When Spout is not found, the SpoutWriter node will not showup. In addition, the StreamReader node will not have Spout as an option from which to read stream data.

If you want to fully turn off the initial startup attempt to import Spout, you can use the environment variable:

`SET JOV_SPOUT=0`

## FFMEPG

The audio nodes require FFMPEG. You can find the official [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org "official FFMPEG binaries") here. Follow it's installation instructions for your specific operating system.
